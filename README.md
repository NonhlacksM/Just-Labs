CGV- Computer graphics and Visualisation:

The following labs introduce the use of HTML Canvas for 2D graphics in web development. HTML Canvas is a versatile tool embedded in the Document Object Model (DOM) of HTML web pages, allowing for custom rendering using JavaScript. The HTML language, in contrast to imperative programming, describes webpage content, while technologies like CSS handle styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity and logic.

The provided example showcases an HTML page with tags structured hierarchically, including a canvas element. The canvas element is defined with attributes like id, width, height, and style. JavaScript is used to draw on this canvas. While these labs don't delve into web development specifics, they focus on leveraging JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive graphics on the HTML Canvas.
